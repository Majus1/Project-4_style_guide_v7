 Creating a reusable Sass framework
The scss file is broken down to base, components and utilities sub folders.
Each sub-folder has multiple files in it.
The files are linked to the _index.scss with the import derctive.
All of the _index.scss files are the imported to style.scss.
The style.scss is then compiled and the the magic happens.
